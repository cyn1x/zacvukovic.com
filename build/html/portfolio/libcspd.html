  <h1>libcspd</h1>
    <p>libcspd is a C utility library designed to provide a collection of data structures and algorithms for learning, performance testing, and practical usage. Inspired by kata-machine by ThePrimeagen, it serves as a resource for mastering fundamental computer science concepts while offering a lightweight, reusable codebase.</p>
    <h2>My Role &amp; Contributions</h2>
    <ul>
    <li>
    <p><strong>Designed &amp; Implemented Core Data Structures</strong>, including but not limited to <strong>vectors, linked lists, stacks, queues, and binary trees</strong>.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
    <p><strong>Focused on Performance &amp; Portability</strong>, ensuring efficient memory usage and cross-platform compatibility.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
    <p><strong>Future Expansions</strong>, such as <strong>binary search trees, hash maps, B-trees, and AVL trees</strong>, along with a potential <strong>testing framework</strong> for more robust validation.</p>
    </li>
    </ul>
    <p>libcspd is an ongoing project aimed at deepening my understanding of systems programming while creating a valuable learning tool for others.</p>
