  <h1>Childcare Safety</h1>
    <p>Childcare Safety is part of a series of educational VR applications developed in collaboration with Meta to highlight the effectiveness of virtual reality in education. This app trains users to identify and sort hazards in a childcare environment, enhancing safety awareness through interactive learning.</p>
    <h2>My Role &amp; Contributions</h2>
    <p>As the lead developer for the Childcare Safety VR training application, developed in collaboration with Meta, I was responsible for guiding the project's development and overcoming key technical challenges to deliver an effective educational experience on the Oculus platform.</p>
    <ul>
    <li>
    <p>Resolved a critical engine rendering bug specific to the Vulkan Graphics API, identifying that the framebuffer was not capturing all data at the end of each render pass. This ensured correct rendering of textures for the hazard camera by correctly showing detected hazard shaders through the URP Forward Renderer.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
    <p>Led the app development, taking ownership of the project's direction, designing the user flow and learning sequence to effectively guide users through the hazard identification training.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
    <p>Rebuilt the interaction system by transitioning from an outdated third-party SDK to our custom interaction platform, resulting in an improved user experience and the addition of expanded features.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
    <p>Applied various performance optimisation techniques that the Oculus review team reported prior to public availability.</p>
    </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Technologies Used</h3>
    <p>Unity: (C#, .NET), Oculus SDK</p>
