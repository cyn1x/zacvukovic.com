  <h1>Canine Anatomy</h1>
    <p>Canine Anatomy showcased how real-time 3D interactivity can transform anatomical education beyond what existing solutions offer. Existing solutions often lacked purpose-built interactivity and real-time manipulation of anatomical layers. This system achieved this in real-time.</p>
    <h2>My Role &amp; Contributions</h2>
    <p>On the Canine Anatomy project, I rebuilt the application using Unity WebGL to deliver a revolutionary real-time 3D anatomy exploration experience, significantly improving usability and performance over existing third-party solutions.</p>
    <ul>
    <li>
    <p>Rebuilt the application in Unity WebGL to enable web-based access and demonstrate the potential of real-time rendering to enhance the interactivity and usability of 3D anatomical models for online learning.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
    <p>Optimised performance to ensure seamless and instantaneous transitions between different anatomical layers, a critical improvement over the slow loading times of existing solutions.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
    <p>Enhanced the user experience by creating an intuitive and interactive real-time anatomy exploration tool specifically designed for educational applications.</p>
    </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Technologies Used</h3>
    <p>Unity: (C#, .NET), WebGL</p>
