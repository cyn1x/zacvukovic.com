  <h1>Canine Anatomy</h1>
    <p><strong>Canine Anatomy</strong> was developed to revolutionise <strong>3D anatomy exploration</strong> by eliminating the long load times typically associated with switching between different anatomical layers. Unlike conventional solutions, our system achieved this in real time, providing a seamless and interactive learning experience.</p>
    <h2>My Role &amp; Contributions</h2>
    <ul>
    <li>
    <p><strong>Rebuilt the App in Unity WebGL</strong> to demonstrate how real-time rendering enhances usability over traditional off-the-shelf 3D explorers.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
    <p><strong>Optimised Performance</strong> to ensure smooth transitions between anatomical layers without delays.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
    <p><strong>Integrated Unity Addressables</strong> to demonstrate how a downloadable content system could be used for multiple 3D anatomical models.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
    <p><strong>Enhanced User Experience</strong> by creating an interactive, real-time anatomy exploration tool better suited for educational applications.</p>
    </li>
    </ul>
    <p>This project showcased how real-time 3D interactivity can transform anatomical education beyond what existing solutions offer.</p>
