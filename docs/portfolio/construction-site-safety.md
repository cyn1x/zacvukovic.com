# Construction Site Safety

The Construction Site Safety Working at Heights virtual reality app was a joint initiative by TAFE NSW and icare that highlighted the importance of working safely at heights.

## My Role & Contributions

- <strong>Led Backend & Infrastructure Development:</strong> Recognising the need for better tooling in immersive application development, I spearheaded the implementation of a scalable CI/CD pipeline. This system automated the build, testing, and deployment of Unity projects directly to VR headsets, significantly improving efficiency for the team.

- <strong>Enterprise Cloud Integration:</strong> Leveraging my development skills and infrastructure experience, I expanded our user profile systems in Unity, integrating them into our enterprise cloud architecture to enhance scalability and accessibility.

- <strong>Core Development Platform Enhancements:</strong> This project drove advancements in our internal development tools, and I took the initiative to scale these improvements beyond the project's completion, ensuring long-term benefits for the team.

<strong>Construction Site Safety</strong> was a <a href="https://good-design.org/projects/tafe-nsw-icare-construction-site-safety-working-heights-program/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2022 Good Design Awards</a> winner.
