# Animal Anatomy Explorer

Animal Anatomy Explorer is part of a series of educational VR applications developed in collaboration with Meta to demonstrate the impact of virtual reality in education. This app teaches users about animal anatomy using highly detailed, anatomically accurate bison and canine models.

## My Role & Contributions

As a key contributor to the Animal Anatomy Explorer VR application, developed in collaboration with Meta, I focused on modernising the user interaction and designing a structured learning experience for exploring detailed anatomical models.

- Modernised the interaction system by transitioning from an outdated third-party SDK to our custom internal platform, resulting in an improved user experience and the implementation of expanded features for interacting with the 3D models.

- Developed core mechanics that underpin user exploration and engagement with the anatomically accurate bison and canine models, ensuring intuitive and effective interaction within the virtual environment. 

- Designed the user flow and integrated the assessment phase, ensuring a structured and intuitive learning progression that guides users through the anatomical exploration leading up to knowledge evaluation.

### Technologies Used
Unity: (C#, .NET), Oculus SDK

Animal Anatomy Explorer is now available on the <a href="https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/5232164040232317/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Oculus App Lab</a>.
