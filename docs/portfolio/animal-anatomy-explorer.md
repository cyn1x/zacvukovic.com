# Animal Anatomy Explorer

Animal Anatomy Explorer is part of a series of educational VR applications developed in collaboration with Meta to demonstrate the impact of virtual reality in education. This app teaches users about animal anatomy using highly detailed, anatomically accurate bison and canine models.

## My Role & Contributions

- <strong>Modernised the Interaction System</strong>, transitioning from an outdated third-party interaction SDK to our custom internal platform with improved user experience and expanded features.

- <strong>Developed Core Mechanics</strong>, contributing to the foundational interactions that allow users to explore and engage with the anatomical models.

- <strong>Designed User Flow & Assessment Integration</strong>, ensuring a structured and intuitive learning experience leading up to the assessment phase.

Animal Anatomy Explorer is now available on the <a href="https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/5232164040232317/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Oculus App Lab</a>.<br /><br />
