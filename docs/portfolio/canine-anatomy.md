# Canine Anatomy

Canine Anatomy showcased how real-time 3D interactivity can transform anatomical education beyond what existing solutions offer. Existing solutions often lacked purpose-built interactivity and real-time manipulation of anatomical layers. This system achieved this in real-time.

## My Role & Contributions
On the Canine Anatomy project, I rebuilt the application using Unity WebGL to deliver a revolutionary real-time 3D anatomy exploration experience, significantly improving usability and performance over existing third-party solutions.

- Rebuilt the application in Unity WebGL to enable web-based access and demonstrate the potential of real-time rendering to enhance the interactivity and usability of 3D anatomical models for online learning.

- Optimised performance to ensure seamless and instantaneous transitions between different anatomical layers, a critical improvement over the slow loading times of existing solutions.

- Enhanced the user experience by creating an intuitive and interactive real-time anatomy exploration tool specifically designed for educational applications.

### Technologies Used
Unity: (C#, .NET), WebGL
