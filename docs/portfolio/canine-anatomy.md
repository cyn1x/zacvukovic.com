# Canine Anatomy

Canine Anatomy was developed to revolutionise 3D anatomy exploration by eliminating the long load times typically associated with switching between different anatomical layers. Unlike conventional solutions, our system achieved this in real time, providing a seamless and interactive learning experience.

## My Role & Contributions

- <strong>Rebuilt the App in Unity WebGL</strong> to demonstrate how real-time rendering enhances usability over traditional off-the-shelf 3D explorers.

- <strong>Optimised Performance</strong> to ensure smooth transitions between anatomical layers without delays.

- <strong>Integrated Unity Addressables</strong> to demonstrate how a downloadable content system could be used for multiple 3D anatomical models.

- <strong>Enhanced User Experience</strong> by creating an interactive, real-time anatomy exploration tool better suited for educational applications.

This project showcased how real-time 3D interactivity can transform anatomical education beyond what existing solutions offer.
