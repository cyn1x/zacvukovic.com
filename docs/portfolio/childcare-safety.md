# Childcare Safety

<strong>Childcare Safety</strong> is part of a series of <strong>educational VR applications</strong> developed in collaboration with <strong>Meta</strong> to highlight the effectiveness of <strong>virtual reality in education.</strong> This app trains users to <strong>identify and sort hazards</strong> in a childcare environment, enhancing safety awareness through interactive learning.

## My Role & Contributions

- <strong>Resolved Engine Rendering Bug</strong>, discovering that the framebuffer used to render textures to the hazard camera did not capture all data at the end of each render pass when Vulkan was set as the Graphics API.

- <strong>Led the App Development,</strong> designing and implementing the flow sequence that guides users through the experience.

- <strong>Rebuilt the Interaction System,</strong> transitioning from an outdated third-party interaction SDK to our custom internal platform with improved user experience and expanded features.

- <strong>Integrated Interactive Elements</strong>, leveraging mechanics from our core platform to create engaging, hands-on learning experiences.

This project demonstrated how <strong>VR can enhance safety training</strong> by offering immersive, scenario-based learning environments.

<strong>Childcare Safety</strong> is available on the <a href="https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/5181967315251271/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Oculus App Lab</a>.<br /><br />
