# libcspd

libcspd is a C utility library designed to provide a collection of data structures and algorithms for learning, performance testing, and practical usage. It serves as a resource for mastering fundamental computer science concepts while offering a lightweight, reusable codebase for quickly building applications in C.

## My Role & Contributions

- <strong>Designed & Implemented Core Data Structures</strong>, including but not limited to <strong>vectors, linked lists, stacks, queues, and binary trees</strong>.

- <strong>Focused on Performance & Portability</strong>, ensuring efficient memory usage and cross-platform compatibility.

- <strong>Future Expansions</strong>, such as <strong>binary search trees, hash maps, B-trees, and AVL trees</strong>, along with a potential <strong>testing framework</strong> for more robust validation.

libcspd is an ongoing project aimed at deepening my understanding of systems programming while creating a valuable learning tool for others.
