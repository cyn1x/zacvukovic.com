# libcspd

libcspd is a C utility library designed to provide a collection of data structures and algorithms for learning, performance testing, and practical usage. It serves as a resource for mastering fundamental and advanced computer science concepts while offering a lightweight, reusable codebase for quickly building applications in C.

## My Role & Contributions

- Designed & Implemented Core Data Structures, including but not limited to vectors, linked lists, stacks, queues, and binary trees.

- Focused on Performance & Portability, ensuring efficient memory usage and cross-platform compatibility.

- Future Expansions, such as binary search trees, hash maps, heaps, B-trees, R-trees, and AVL trees, along with a potential testing framework for more robust validation.

libcspd is an ongoing project aimed at deepening my understanding of data structures and algorithms, while creating a valuable learning tool for others.
