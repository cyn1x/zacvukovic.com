# Now

Inspired by the <a href="https://nownownow.com/about" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">"now page"</a>, this page will show what I'm focused on at this point in my life.

*Last updated 2025-05-23*

## Game Engine Development in C++

I'm working on my own game engine in C++, and am currently prototyping the Windows platform layer. I'm only focusing on Windows for the foreseeable future, which is a pretty obvious choice for game developers when taking a look at the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/hwsurvey" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Steam Hardware & Software Survey</a>. Developing the Linux and MacOS platform layers will only serve as a learning exercise when I feel like exploring the topic of porting games to other platforms.

Current features:

- &#x2705; Software rendering
- &#x2705; Event system
- &#x2705; Keyboard and mouse input

**Future plans:**

- &#x1F504; <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/direct3d11/atoc-dx-graphics-direct3d-11" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DirectX 11</a> renderer
- &#x23F3; <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/xinput/xinput-game-controller-apis-portal" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">XInput</a> gamepad controls
- &#x23F3; <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/xaudio2/xaudio2-apis-portal" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">XAudio2</a> audio layer
- &#x23F3; Mathematics library
- &#x23F3; Memory management system
- &#x23F3; Performance profiling
- &#x23F3; Hot reloading

*Why another engine?* This gets asked a lot, and the answer is to gain a strong fundamental knowledge of the complex architectures in game and rendering engines.

## C Utility Library

I spend a lot of time returning to fundamentals in other disciplines, so why not Computer Science as well? I'm working on <a href="https://github.com/cyn1x/libcspd" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">libcspd</a> to focus on learning and eventually teaching fundamental and advanced computer science concepts while offering a lightweight, reusable codebase for quickly building applications in C.

Current features:

- &#x2705; Vector
- &#x2705; Linked List
- &#x2705; Stack
- &#x2705; Queue
- &#x2705; Binary Tree

**Future Plans:**

- &#x1F504; Binary Search Tree
- &#x1F504; Hash map
- &#x1F504; Heap
- &#x23F3; B-tree
- &#x23F3; R-tree
- &#x23F3; AVL Tree

I'm considering integrating a robust testing framework rather than relying on assert statements for more effective testing.

## Chess Engine in Rust

I'm building a chess engine with a Rust backend and TypeScript frontend as an exercise in real-world AI/ML algorithm and optimisation techniques. The focus is on implementing search algorithms, evaluation functions, and eventually self-learning techniques to improve gameplay over time.

The core engine was originally built in TypeScript several years ago, but as the complexity of the logic increased, I recognised the need to transition performance-critical components to Rust before introducing AI and machine learning algorithms.

Current features:

- &#x2705; HTML5 Canvas chessboard
- &#x2705; Rust websocket server

**Future plans:**

- &#x1F504; Rewrite board logic in Rust
- &#x23F3; AI opponent (minimax, alpha-beta pruning)
- &#x23F3; ML-based board evaluation
- &#x23F3; Reinforcement learning for self-play

## Audio Engineering

I have recently been enjoying removing the guitar tracks from audio files and playing over the top of them, learning how to mix it all together. The current dilemma is figuring out how to emulate tone digitally without having to spend lots of money on physical gear.

My most recent recording is on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2X6JcpuwpY" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">YouTube</a>. This was recorded through an audio interface with a Fender Mexican Stratocaster plugged into a Randall T2 head, which isn't exactly great given the Randall T2 head is geared for high-gain metal.

Upcoming covers:

- Clouds Over California - DevilDriver
- 11th Hour - Lamb of God
- Bodom Beach Terror - Children of Bodom

That's just a few I currently have in mind. If you'd like me to cover a particular song, please do let me know!

I have some old original demos on my <a href="https://soundcloud.com/crackimus" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SoundCloud</a> page which were geared for vocals, but never eventuated. At the moment, I'm more focused more on learning from better guitarists, playing precision, and theory.
